            <h3> About DXC and it's history? </h3>
         <p>  <strong>DXC Technology </strong> is an American multinational information technology (IT) services and consulting company headquartered in Ashburn, Virginia.
            DXC Technology was founded on <strong> April 3, 2017 </strong> when Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services business unit merged with Computer Sciences Corporation. It began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DXC. At the time of its creation, DXC Technology had revenues of <strong>$25 billion</strong>.
            In India, the company started a three-year plan to reduce the number of offices in the country from 50 to 26, and reduce headcount by 5.9% (around 10,000) employees. With about <strong>43,000 employees (more than a third of its workforce) in India</strong>, the company is restructuring its workforce to meet its new revenue profile.
            In 2017, DXC split off its US public sector segment to create a new company, Perspecta Inc.
            <strong>Mike Salvino</strong>, the former Accenture chief group executive, was named president and CEO of DXC Technology in 2019.
            In February 2021, French technology services and consulting firm Atos ended talks for a potential acquisition of DXC. Atos had proposed for US$10 billion including debt for acquisition.
            As of November 2021, DXC employed <strong>134,000</strong> in over 70 countries, including the United States, India, the Philippines, Central Europe and Vietnam. </p>
